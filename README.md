# Analyzing-Customer-Shopping-Data-using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning analysis of customer shopping data (customer segmentation) using clustering, featuring in-depth data exploration and model evaluation with a dataset found on Kaggle.com.

About the Dataset:

The dataset, named "customer_shopping_data.csv", includes various parameters related to customer shopping data collected from the different malls in Istanbul, TÃ¼rkiye between 2021-2023. These parameters include but are not limited to invoice number,	customer ID,	gender,	age,	category,	quantity,	price,	payment method,	invoice date, and	shopping mall. Data cleaning and preprocessing were significant initial steps to ensure quality and reliability of the analysis.


Methodology:

I employed clustering for this project, which is an ideal choice for customer segmentation problems, such as this one. The project workflow encompasses:

Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing. 
In-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover initial patterns and insights. 
Feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model. 
K-Means clustering model development. 
Evaluation of the model using the silhouette score metric.


Key Findings:

The project revealed two different customer groups that shopped at the malls in Istanbul.


Technologies Used:

Python for overall data analysis and machine learning. The Pandas library was utilized for data manipulation. Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the data. Scikit-learn for implementing and evaluating the clustering model.
